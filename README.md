# EventAnalyser
Event analyser is a RestAPI written in Golang. It is an analyze tool that can be used
for storing and analyzing some specified type data using MySQL database technology.
If you have some data for requests of specific users using specific apps and if you 
want to analyze your response time per app in this data, then you can use this app
by storing your data toa JSON file as event definitions that composes of userIDs,
ApiIds and response time info.

Installation:

Assuming that go is set up already, install following three dependencies
before moving on. Here go-chart library is used to analyze stored event data.

go get "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"

go get "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

go get github.com/wcharczuk/go-chart



For client-server connection, Gin is used in this API. Gin is a HTTP web
framework written in Go (Golang). If your data is big, processing time is
important and here Gin serves you well with its performance. It is simple 
to learn how Gin works but hard to master. It has a huge community of 
followers and it is a mature framework having a development history of 2 years
which probably makes it almost bug free Via Gin framework you can render
your plots into your web-page easily unlike some other HTTP frameworks like Mux.
This app requires parsing parameters from URL and it is easy to parse parameters
with Gin. Gin has the same philosophy like httpRouter as it is built on top of 
it which makes its performance better thanks to fast data passing between middlewares.
So if performance is everything for you, Gin can serve you well.

Having told why I chose Gin, now, before running the API, firstly create a database
in MySQL explicitly. Then give the name of the database, MySQL username and password
in  const variables section of createTables.go file. Also make sure that you are using
port 3306 in MySQL. If that port is used by another application in your computer, you
can change the port name in const variable list as well. Also 3232 port is used in the
connection between client and server using Gin framework. If another application is
using that port in your computer, you need to change that port in const variables 
sections in both client and server package.

Now your server is ready to go.
You can run the server. Gin-gonic creates the environment and port connection. When
the app is run, at first database relations are created in MySQL in main method if
they had not been created before by calling createTables() method just in the first
line of main method. Then server listens for GET and POST requests. POST request is
made for adding events and GET is for analyzing events.

In client package, there is a JSON data of 100 test events that can be sent to
server to be stored in database automatically. You can do it by simply running 
client.exe in client package. You can send your own event data by manipulating 
the pre-created JSON file that is in the client package. JSON has a readable,
user-friendly format and less grammer. JSON is processed quite fast as it has 
a simpler structure so less markup overhead compated to XML 


Now run the the client side. Event logs from
the JSON file will be automatically send to server and inserted to database using
POST requests. JSON file can be updated to send more event definitions automatically.
An example request can be defined as follows:

http://localhost:3232/event/?api_key=10&user_id=1&unix_timestamp=1485084687

As a second option, event data can be sent via POST request manually using Postman
application. You can download Postman from the following link:

Running the client side and having some event storage in database, now analysis part 
can be done sending a GET request to server. Just open your browser and type the
following:

http://localhost:3232/event (change port number if yours is different)

Now you will see a chart that shows percentages of events corresponding to some specified
buckets in terms of their processing times. You can analyze your event data using this
chart and customize it for yourself if you wish.
